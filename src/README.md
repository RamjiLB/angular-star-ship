Hi,
I have done the test case in jasmine and to see the execution and result of test cases, kindly follow below steps. Currently it is configured to run the application

if you are going to review and run test cases in stackblitz follow steps given beow, alternatively if you want to check test cases in local machine no need to follow below steps

1) Rename existing main.ts file to main-code.ts or anything that is easy for you to identify this file. As later we have to revert this rename.

2) Rename test-main.ts to main.ts and save and run the application and it will show the test case results.

3) To put it back in to the application mode revert the changes we have made.
